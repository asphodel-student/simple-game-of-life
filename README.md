OOP, NSU, Problem 2

Simple implementation of Conway's game of life.

How to use:

1. Enter input file name, number of iterations and output file name.
For example: GameOfLife.exe <name-of-universe> -i 5 -o <output-file-name>

After all iterations program save current game state to your output file

2. Enter only a input file name
In this case you can write commands to run game during executions

Commans:
tick<n> - show n next iterations
help - show game reference
dump<file name> - save current game state to output file
exit - stop the game

3. Enter nothing, just start the game :)
In this case you will see one of a default game field
